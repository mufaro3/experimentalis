Experimentalis documentation
============================

The Experimentalis ("Experimental Analysis") library is a formalized library for performing basic modeling and measurement analysis for physics experiments. It has to constantly change to match whatever I need each week, so this is not recommended to be used as an actual library. (It's really the final evolution of a disjointed series of laboratory functions, cleaned up and given some proper tests, examples, and documentation.)
