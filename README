experimentalis

The Experimentalis ("Experiment Analysis") Library is a series of functions
that have evolved out of a several thousand line long mess of laboratory
analysis functions that I've been developing over the past two years.

It was originally designed for performing some very, very simple data
analysis and model fitting, particularly for working with oscilloscopes
and circuits, but as I've continued onward, it's become more of a general
library for building and analyzing model fits, especially for fitting time
series.

To understand how to use the library, I recommend visiting the documentation
website

ripe with examples and whatnot for how to use it. Again, it's intended to be
more like a very formal function collection library, so this library will
continuously grow with more functions as I need them. PRs are welcome.

I will probably not end up releasing this library on Pip. I don't actually
recommend this library for general use, it is much too hacky.

Thanks,

Moofy
